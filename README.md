## 🆕 What's New in v2026-04-12

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **bmad-gds: game producer/orchestration rewrite** | Reframed `bmad-gds` from a generic phase catalog into a practical game-production coordination skill. It now acts as the repo's game-cluster orchestrator: normalizes mixed packets (idea, GDD, playtest notes, bug/build issues, launch targets), chooses one operating mode, produces one milestone-aware coordination brief, and routes detailed work to `game-demo-feedback-triage`, `game-build-log-triage`, `game-performance-profiler`, `steam-store-launch-ops`, `task-planning`, or `bmad-idea` as needed. Added `references/operating-modes.md`, `references/scope-boundaries.md`, and `evals/evals.json` without increasing the skill count. |

## 🆕 What's New in v2026-04-08

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **graphify: repo and corpus knowledge-graph skill** | Added a dedicated `graphify` skill for turning repositories or mixed corpora into persistent knowledge-graph artifacts with `GRAPH_REPORT.md`, `graph.json`, and HTML visualization. Covers the tested Python API pipeline, graph queries, graph-backed architecture discovery, and assistant install flows; includes `references/overview.md` and `evals/evals.json`. 84 → **85 skills**. |
| **llm-wiki: persistent LLM-maintained markdown wiki skill** | Added a dedicated `llm-wiki` skill for turning raw sources into a compounding Obsidian or markdown knowledge base. It bootstraps a vault with `raw/`, `wiki/`, `index.md`, `log.md`, and `AGENTS.md`; ships helper scripts for bootstrap, Scrapling-powered URL ingest, query filing, and linting; and pushes schema, ingest, filing, and scaling detail into focused references. Includes `evals/` plus `skill-autoresearch-llm-wiki/` baseline, changelog, results, and dashboard artifacts. 82 → **83 skills**. |
| **rtk: Rust Token Killer setup and operations skill** | Added a dedicated `rtk` skill for installing, verifying, and initializing Rust Token Killer across Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Cline, and OpenCode. The skill starts with `rtk gain` verification, handles the common wrong-package collision, ships install/init/status wrapper scripts, and pushes deeper platform and troubleshooting details into focused reference docs. Includes `evals/` plus `skill-autoresearch-rtk/` baseline, changelog, results, and dashboard artifacts. 81 → **82 skills**. |

## 🆕 What's New in v2026-03-30

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **harness: agent team & skill architect meta-skill** | Added a dedicated `harness` skill for designing domain-specific agent teams and generating the skills they use. Covers domain analysis, architecture pattern selection (pipeline, fan-out/fan-in, expert pool, producer-reviewer, supervisor, hierarchical delegation), `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/skills/` file generation, orchestration workflow definition, and validation with trigger evals and dry-run testing. Includes `install.sh`, `validate-harness.sh` scripts, and 5 reference docs. 80 → **81 skills**. |

## 🆕 What's New in v2026-03-28

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **obsidian-cli: terminal automation for Obsidian** | Added a dedicated `obsidian-cli` skill for enabling and operating the official Obsidian CLI: installer and registration preflight, TUI vs one-shot usage, `vault=` / `file=` / `path=` targeting, `--copy`, everyday note workflows, plugin and theme control, developer commands like `plugin:reload` and `dev:screenshot`, plus platform troubleshooting references. 79 → **80 skills**. |
| **scrapling: adaptive web scraping skill** | Added a dedicated `scrapling` skill for parser-first HTML extraction, fetcher selection (`Fetcher` → `DynamicFetcher` → `StealthyFetcher`), extras-aware installation, adaptive selector recovery, CLI extraction, and second-tier MCP/spider guidance. The implementation includes install/extract/MCP wrapper scripts plus focused references for fetchers, parser behavior, CLI/MCP, and spiders. 78 → **79 skills**. |
| **strix: AI-driven application security testing skill** | Added a dedicated `strix` skill for operating the Strix CLI end-to-end: install and Docker preflight, `STRIX_LLM` provider setup, local/GitHub/live target scans, quick/standard/deep mode selection, headless CI/CD usage, and clear separation between this repo's skill and Strix internal security skills. 77 → **78 skills**. |

## 🆕 What's New in v2026-03-22

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **bmad-orchestrator renamed to bmad** | `bmad-orchestrator` skill folder renamed to `bmad`. Simplified to core BMAD workflow orchestration (Analysis → Planning → Solutioning → Implementation). Use keyword `bmad` as before. |

Covers all 27 `eslint-plugin-obsidianmd` rules, interactive boilerplate generator (`create-plugin.js`), memory management, type safety, accessibility (MANDATORY), CSS variables, vault API, and community submission validation. 75 → **76 skills**. |
| **jeo v1.6.0: `.jeo` planning ledger flow** | JEO now creates a project-local `.jeo/` folder and uses it as a durable planning/development/QA ledger: `long-term.md`, `short-term.md`, `planned.md`, `progress.md`, `history.md`, plus queued/active task files. Completed task files are summarized into history then removed; follow-up work can be queued without resetting the workflow. |
| **skill-autoresearch: eval-driven skill optimization** | New skill for improving an existing `SKILL.md` with binary evals, mutation loops, baseline scoring, and dashboard/changelog artifacts. Keeps the original `autoresearch` ML workflow separate. 76 → **77 skills**. |

## 🧬 TOON Format Injection

TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) compresses the skill catalog and auto-injects it into every prompt. **40-50% token savings** vs JSON/Markdown.

| Platform | File | Mechanism |
|----------|------|-----------|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/hooks/toon-inject.mjs` | `UserPromptSubmit` hook — 26-37ms |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/hooks/toon-skill-inject.sh` | `includeDirectories` session load |
| Codex CLI | `~/.codex/skills-toon-catalog.toon` | Static catalog |

- **Tier 1** (always): Skill catalog index (~875-3,500 tokens) — names + descriptions + tags
- **Tier 2** (on-demand): Individual SKILL.toon content (~292 tokens/skill, max 3)
