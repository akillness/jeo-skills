## 🆕 What's New in v2026-04-17

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **steam-store-launch-ops: bottleneck-router hardening** | Tightened `steam-store-launch-ops` into a diagnosis-first Steam launch/store router for indie games. It now separates `visibility-acquisition`, `promise-clarity`, `proof-demo-readiness`, `timing-hook-fit`, and `launch-ops-readiness`; makes the current hook explicit (coming-soon page, wishlist anomaly, demo decision, Next Fest, or launch window); recommends one intervention and one next artifact instead of a generic marketing dump; and adds `references/diagnostic-model.md`, `references/event-hooks.md`, refreshed `evals/evals.json`, and synced `SKILL.toon` without adding a duplicate game-marketing skill. |

## 🆕 What's New in v2026-04-15

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **game-performance-profiler: quick-packet + device-review hardening** | Upgraded `game-performance-profiler` so the game-performance lane now starts from the evidence packet teams actually have: profiler or overlay screenshots, `stat unit` / `stat gpu` output, benchmark-route complaints, and Steam Deck or packaged-on-device review notes. The skill now chooses among quick-triage, bottleneck-classification, benchmark-route, device-review, and escalation modes; adds `references/capture-packets-and-benchmark-routes.md`, `references/device-review-and-steam-deck.md`, `references/escalation-ladder.md`, refreshed `references/profiling-patterns.md`, `evals/evals.json`, and `SKILL.toon`; and sharpens route-outs to `game-demo-feedback-triage`, `game-build-log-triage`, `game-ci-cd-pipeline`, and `performance-optimization` without increasing the skill count. |
| **agent-browser: fresh-session verification rewrite** | Reframed `agent-browser` from a generic browser CLI guide into the browser-review lane's **fresh-session deterministic verification** anchor. It now chooses the clean browser lane first, enforces an observe → act → observe loop, makes route-outs explicit to `playwriter`, `agentation`, and `plannotator`, adds `references/modes-and-routing.md` plus `evals/evals.json`, and keeps auth reuse bounded instead of silently sliding into a running-browser workflow. |
| **agentation: UI annotation router rewrite** | Reframed `agentation` from a monolithic install/config catalog into the planning-review lane's exact rendered-UI feedback router. It now chooses among copy-paste review, synced watch-loop, self-driving critique, and platform-setup modes; keeps route-outs explicit to `agent-browser`, `playwriter`, and `plannotator`; adds `references/modes-and-routing.md`, `references/platform-setup-and-hooks.md`, `references/watch-loop-and-self-driving.md`, and `evals/evals.json`; and fixes top-level discovery surfaces so the repo now consistently advertises **89 skills**. |
| **git-submodule: submodule-operator rewrite** | Reframed `git-submodule` from a legacy command catalog into the utilities lane's decision-first submodule anchor. It now decides between submodule vs subtree/vendoring/package delivery first; chooses one workflow mode (`boundary decision`, `add-and-pin`, `bootstrap-and-clone`, `sync-to-pinned-commit`, `advance-tracked-branch`, `edit-inside-submodule`, `remove-and-cleanup`, or `ci-checkout`); makes detached-HEAD, pointer, and CI/auth consequences explicit; routes generic history cleanup to `git-workflow` and package delivery to `npm-git-install`; and ships `references/decision-matrix.md`, `references/update-and-detached-head.md`, `references/ci-and-automation.md`, and `evals/evals.json` without increasing the skill count. |
| **bmad-idea: pre-planning concept-router rewrite** | Reframed `bmad-idea` from a legacy BMAD-CIS command/persona catalog into the repository's pre-planning idea router. It now normalizes early-stage product, GTM, consulting, and game packets; chooses one framing mode (`problem framing`, `audience and value framing`, `concept shaping`, `game concept framing`, or `story packaging`); produces one reusable concept artifact; routes cleanly to `bmad`, `task-planning`, `marketing-automation`, or `bmad-gds`; and ships `references/operating-modes.md`, `references/handoff-boundaries.md`, `references/concept-packet-template.md`, and `evals/evals.json` without increasing the skill count. |
| **genkit: full-stack AI workflow rewrite** | Reframed `genkit` from a long command/example dump into the Firebase/fullstack lane's **backend AI workflow anchor**. It now chooses among flow-foundation, tool-and-agent, retrieval-and-prompt, evaluation-and-observability, and deployment-runtime modes; keeps direct Firebase app/client SDK work routed to `firebase-ai-logic`; adds `references/modes-and-routing.md`, `references/deployment-and-runtime-boundaries.md`, `references/evals-and-observability.md`, and `evals/evals.json`; and updates discovery surfaces so Genkit is positioned as the reusable server-owned workflow layer rather than a generic snippet catalog. |
| **firebase-ai-logic: client-integration support hardening** | Upgraded `firebase-ai-logic` from a thin companion note into the Firebase lane's **app/client integration anchor**. It now chooses among direct feature fit, app wiring, production hardening, and escalation-boundary modes; adds `references/modes-and-routing.md`, `references/production-controls.md`, `references/feature-packets.md`, and `evals/evals.json`; makes route-outs explicit to `genkit` for backend workflows and `firebase-cli` for operator tasks; and removes stale setup guidance that previously blurred app SDK work with backend orchestration. |

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **npm-git-install: Git-dependency decision rewrite** | Reframed `npm-git-install` from a legacy npm-only command dump into a decision-first Node package delivery skill. It now chooses between direct Git install, SHA-pinned bridge installs, private Git auth, tarball / `npm pack` artifacts, workspace / `file:` links, and publish-first registry paths; covers npm, pnpm, Yarn, and Bun at the workflow level; adds explicit auth/build/reproducibility guardrails and route-outs to `git-workflow`, `github-repo-management`, `workflow-automation`, and `system-environment-setup`; and ships `references/delivery-decision-matrix.md`, `references/package-manager-behavior.md`, `references/private-auth-and-ci.md`, and `evals/evals.json` without increasing the skill count. |
| **web-design-guidelines: UI-audit rewrite** | Reframed `web-design-guidelines` from a thin Vercel-rules fetcher into the frontend cluster's broad interface audit anchor for launch-readiness, polish/consistency, flow-friction, heuristic, and rule-overlay reviews. It now classifies findings across hierarchy, clarity, states, responsiveness basics, accessibility basics, and performance/trust signals; adds explicit route-outs to `web-accessibility`, `responsive-design`, `ui-component-patterns`, `design-system`, and `react-best-practices`; and ships `references/review-modes-and-categories.md`, `references/handoff-boundaries.md`, `references/ui-audit-packet-template.md`, and `evals/evals.json` without increasing the skill count. |
| **monitoring-observability: telemetry-review rewrite** | Reframed `monitoring-observability` from a generic Prometheus/logging snippet dump into a mode-selecting observability anchor for service reliability, telemetry foundations, data/marketing pipeline health, game live-ops visibility, and stack-review audits. It now applies symptom-first alerting, explicit dashboard/ownership checks, and route-outs to `log-analysis`, `debugging`, `performance-optimization`, `langsmith`, `deployment-automation`, and `game-performance-profiler`; and ships `references/modes-and-boundaries.md`, `references/alert-dashboard-checklist.md`, `references/telemetry-rollout-matrix.md`, and `evals/evals.json` without increasing the skill count. |
| **performance-optimization: bottleneck-workflow rewrite** | Reframed `performance-optimization` from a generic React/database optimization dump into the code-quality cluster's measurement-led tuning anchor. It now classifies interaction, page-load, API, DB, capacity, memory, and runtime bottleneck modes; chooses the right evidence source before proposing fixes; adds route-outs to `monitoring-observability`, `debugging`, `code-refactoring`, `testing-strategies`, and `game-performance-profiler`; and ships `references/tuning-modes.md`, `references/handoff-boundaries.md`, `references/measurement-checklist.md`, and `evals/evals.json` without increasing the skill count. |
| **code-refactoring: behavior-preserving rewrite** | Reframed `code-refactoring` from a long textbook pattern dump into the code-quality cluster's structure-improvement anchor. It now chooses between local safe refactors, behavior-freeze-first cleanup, and repetitive migration / codemod work; keeps tests, search, and reviewable slices explicit; adds route-outs to `debugging`, `code-review`, `testing-strategies`, `performance-optimization`, and `codebase-search`; and ships `references/refactor-modes.md`, `references/handoff-boundaries.md`, `references/safe-refactor-checklist.md`, and `evals/evals.json` without increasing the skill count. |
| **changelog-maintenance: release-history rewrite** | Reframed `changelog-maintenance` from a generic semver/example dump into the documentation cluster's release-history / release-notes anchor. It now selects among changelog, release-notes, migration-update, and game-patch-note workflows; adds route-outs to `technical-writing`, `api-documentation`, `user-guide-writing`, `deployment-automation`, and `marketing-automation`; and ships `references/automation-and-source-of-truth.md`, `references/modes-and-boundaries.md`, `references/release-note-quality-checklist.md`, and `evals/evals.json` without increasing the skill count. |

## 🆕 What's New in v2026-04-13

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **responsive-design: layout-adaptation rewrite** | Reframed `responsive-design` from a long generic CSS example dump into the frontend cluster's mobile-first, container-aware layout adaptation skill. It now classifies viewport-vs-container failures, prioritizes intrinsic layout before breakpoint sprawl, adds explicit route-outs to `ui-component-patterns`, `web-accessibility`, `design-system`, and `web-design-guidelines`, and ships `references/layout-decision-checklist.md`, `references/handoff-boundaries.md`, and `evals/evals.json` without increasing the skill count. |

## 🆕 What's New in v2026-04-12

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **bmad: core BMAD router modernization** | Reframed `bmad` into the portable BMAD/BMM core router: it now chooses project level, identifies the current phase, recommends one next artifact, and routes runtime-specific or specialist depth to `plannotator`, `task-planning`, `omc`, `omx`, `ohmg`, or `bmad-gds` instead of acting like a giant command dump. Added `references/core-routing.md`, `references/status-and-review.md`, `references/runtime-and-module-boundaries.md`, and `evals/evals.json`, while keeping the existing helper scripts. |
| **bmad-gds: game producer/orchestration rewrite** | Reframed `bmad-gds` from a generic phase catalog into a practical game-production coordination skill. It now acts as the repo's game-cluster orchestrator: normalizes mixed packets (idea, GDD, playtest notes, bug/build issues, launch targets), chooses one operating mode, produces one milestone-aware coordination brief, and routes detailed work to `game-demo-feedback-triage`, `game-build-log-triage`, `game-performance-profiler`, `steam-store-launch-ops`, `task-planning`, or `bmad-idea` as needed. Added `references/operating-modes.md`, `references/scope-boundaries.md`, and `evals/evals.json` without increasing the skill count. |

## 🧬 TOON Format Injection

TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) compresses the skill catalog and auto-injects it into every prompt. **40-50% token savings** vs JSON/Markdown.

| Platform | File | Mechanism |
|----------|------|-----------|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/hooks/toon-inject.mjs` | `UserPromptSubmit` hook — 26-37ms |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/hooks/toon-skill-inject.sh` | `includeDirectories` session load |
| Codex CLI | `~/.codex/skills-toon-catalog.toon` | Static catalog |

- **Tier 1** (always): Skill catalog index (~875-3,500 tokens) — names + descriptions + tags
- **Tier 2** (on-demand): Individual SKILL.toon content (~292 tokens/skill, max 3)

## 🔮 Featured Tools

### jeo — Integrated Agent Orchestration
> Keyword: `jeo` · `annotate` | Platforms: Claude · Codex · Gemini · OpenCode

Complete integrated delivery loop: Plan (ralph+plannotator) → Execute (platform runtime or bmad) → Verify (agent-browser) → optional submit-gated UI Feedback (agentation) → Cleanup.

JEO also maintains a project-local `.jeo/` ledger plus resumable `.omc/state/jeo-state.json`, so the workflow keeps durable long-term rules, short-term system/test plans, queued work, live progress notes, and append-only history across sessions.

| Phase | Tool | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Plan / Planning | ralph + plannotator + `.jeo/short-term.md` | Visual plan review plus system/unit/flow test planning |
| Execute / Development | omc team / bmad + `.jeo/tasks/active/*.md` | Parallel agent execution with active work-item tracking |
| Verify / QA | agent-browser + agentation (`annotate`) | Browser behavior verification, annotation fixes, QA evidence |
| Cleanup | worktree-cleanup.sh | Auto worktree cleanup |

### plannotator — Visual Plan Review
> Keyword: `plan` | [Docs](docs/plannotator/README.md) | [GitHub](https://github.com/backnotprop/plannotator)

Browser UI for annotating AI plans. Approve or send structured feedback in one click. Works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, and Codex CLI.

```bash
bash scripts/install.sh --all
```

### ralph — Specification-First Development
> Keyword: `ralph`, `ooo` | [Docs](docs/ralph/README.md) | [GitHub](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros)

Socratic interview → immutable seed/spec → execute against the contract → verify before done → keep looping until completion is actually verified. Runtime-specific hook / approval / harness details stay in `omc`, `omx`, `ohmg`, `jeo`, and `ralphmode`.

```bash
ooo interview "I want to build a task management CLI"
ooo seed && ooo run && ooo evaluate <session_id>
ooo ralph "fix all failing tests"
```

### vibe-kanban — AI Agent Kanban Board
> Keyword: `kanbanview` | [Docs](docs/vibe-kanban/README.md) | [GitHub](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban)

Board/workspace control plane for bounded coding tasks: run parallel AI agents in isolated worktrees, keep human review explicit, and hand off cleanly to PRs.

```bash
npx vibe-kanban
```
