## 💡 What is Agent Skills?

**85 AI agent skills · TOON Format · Cross-platform**

Agent Skills is a curated collection of 85 AI agent skills for LLM-based development workflows. Built around the `jeo` orchestration protocol, it provides:
- Unified orchestration across Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex, and OpenCode
- Plan → Execute → Verify → Cleanup automated pipelines
- Multi-agent team coordination with parallel execution

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

> **Prerequisite**: Install `skills` CLI before running `npx skills add`.
>
> ```bash
> npm install -g skills
> ```

```bash
# Send to your LLM agent — it will read and install automatically
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akillness/oh-my-skills/main/setup-all-skills-prompt.md
```

## 🆕 What's New in v2026-04-14

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **performance-optimization: bottleneck-workflow rewrite** | Reframed `performance-optimization` from a generic React/database optimization dump into the code-quality cluster's measurement-led tuning anchor. It now classifies interaction, page-load, API, DB, capacity, memory, and runtime bottleneck modes; chooses the right evidence source before proposing fixes; adds route-outs to `monitoring-observability`, `debugging`, `code-refactoring`, `testing-strategies`, and `game-performance-profiler`; and ships `references/tuning-modes.md`, `references/handoff-boundaries.md`, `references/measurement-checklist.md`, and `evals/evals.json` without increasing the skill count. |
| **code-refactoring: behavior-preserving rewrite** | Reframed `code-refactoring` from a long textbook pattern dump into the code-quality cluster's structure-improvement anchor. It now chooses between local safe refactors, behavior-freeze-first cleanup, and repetitive migration / codemod work; keeps tests, search, and reviewable slices explicit; adds route-outs to `debugging`, `code-review`, `testing-strategies`, `performance-optimization`, and `codebase-search`; and ships `references/refactor-modes.md`, `references/handoff-boundaries.md`, `references/safe-refactor-checklist.md`, and `evals/evals.json` without increasing the skill count. |
| **changelog-maintenance: release-history rewrite** | Reframed `changelog-maintenance` from a generic semver/example dump into the documentation cluster's release-history / release-notes anchor. It now selects among changelog, release-notes, migration-update, and game-patch-note workflows; adds route-outs to `technical-writing`, `api-documentation`, `user-guide-writing`, `deployment-automation`, and `marketing-automation`; and ships `references/automation-and-source-of-truth.md`, `references/modes-and-boundaries.md`, `references/release-note-quality-checklist.md`, and `evals/evals.json` without increasing the skill count. |

## 🆕 What's New in v2026-04-13

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **responsive-design: layout-adaptation rewrite** | Reframed `responsive-design` from a long generic CSS example dump into the frontend cluster's mobile-first, container-aware layout adaptation skill. It now classifies viewport-vs-container failures, prioritizes intrinsic layout before breakpoint sprawl, adds explicit route-outs to `ui-component-patterns`, `web-accessibility`, `design-system`, and `web-design-guidelines`, and ships `references/layout-decision-checklist.md`, `references/handoff-boundaries.md`, and `evals/evals.json` without increasing the skill count. |

## 🆕 What's New in v2026-04-12

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **bmad-gds: game producer/orchestration rewrite** | Reframed `bmad-gds` from a generic phase catalog into a practical game-production coordination skill. It now acts as the repo's game-cluster orchestrator: normalizes mixed packets (idea, GDD, playtest notes, bug/build issues, launch targets), chooses one operating mode, produces one milestone-aware coordination brief, and routes detailed work to `game-demo-feedback-triage`, `game-build-log-triage`, `game-performance-profiler`, `steam-store-launch-ops`, `task-planning`, or `bmad-idea` as needed. Added `references/operating-modes.md`, `references/scope-boundaries.md`, and `evals/evals.json` without increasing the skill count. |

## 🆕 What's New in v2026-04-08

| Change | Details |

| **rtk: Rust Token Killer setup and operations skill** | Added a dedicated `rtk` skill for installing, verifying, and initializing Rust Token Killer across Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Cline, and OpenCode. The skill starts with `rtk gain` verification, handles the common wrong-package collision, ships install/init/status wrapper scripts, and pushes deeper platform and troubleshooting details into focused reference docs. Includes `evals/` plus `skill-autoresearch-rtk/` baseline, changelog, results, and dashboard artifacts. 81 → **82 skills**. |

## 🆕 What's New in v2026-03-30

| **scrapling: adaptive web scraping skill** | Added a dedicated `scrapling` skill for parser-first HTML extraction, fetcher selection (`Fetcher` → `DynamicFetcher` → `StealthyFetcher`), extras-aware installation, adaptive selector recovery, CLI extraction, and second-tier MCP/spider guidance. The implementation includes install/extract/MCP wrapper scripts plus focused references for fetchers, parser behavior, CLI/MCP, and spiders. 78 → **79 skills**. |
| **strix: AI-driven application security testing skill** | Added a dedicated `strix` skill for operating the Strix CLI end-to-end: install and Docker preflight, `STRIX_LLM` provider setup, local/GitHub/live target scans, quick/standard/deep mode selection, headless CI/CD usage, and clear separation between this repo's skill and Strix internal security skills. 77 → **78 skills**. |

Covers all 27 `eslint-plugin-obsidianmd` rules, interactive boilerplate generator (`create-plugin.js`), memory management, type safety, accessibility (MANDATORY), CSS variables, vault API, and community submission validation. 75 → **76 skills**. |
| **jeo v1.6.0: `.jeo` planning ledger flow** | JEO now creates a project-local `.jeo/` folder and uses it as a durable planning/development/QA ledger: `long-term.md`, `short-term.md`, `planned.md`, `progress.md`, `history.md`, plus queued/active task files. Completed task files are summarized into history then removed; follow-up work can be queued without resetting the workflow. |
| **skill-autoresearch: eval-driven skill optimization** | New skill for improving an existing `SKILL.md` with binary evals, mutation loops, baseline scoring, and dashboard/changelog artifacts. Keeps the original `autoresearch` ML workflow separate. 76 → **77 skills**. |

## 🧬 TOON Format Injection

TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) compresses the skill catalog and auto-injects it into every prompt. **40-50% token savings** vs JSON/Markdown.

| Platform | File | Mechanism |
|----------|------|-----------|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/hooks/toon-inject.mjs` | `UserPromptSubmit` hook — 26-37ms |
| Gemini CLI | `~/.gemini/hooks/toon-skill-inject.sh` | `includeDirectories` session load |
| Codex CLI | `~/.codex/skills-toon-catalog.toon` | Static catalog |

- **Tier 1** (always): Skill catalog index (~875-3,500 tokens) — names + descriptions + tags
- **Tier 2** (on-demand): Individual SKILL.toon content (~292 tokens/skill, max 3)
